# Bug Investigation: Premature Publication of Scheduled Posts

## Issue Summary
**Date Reported:** 03/10/2025  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Status:** Under Investigation  

## Problem Description
The KSM Post Scheduler plugin appears to be causing scheduled posts to be published prematurely while retaining their original scheduled publication dates.

### Observed Behavior
- Posts scheduled for future dates are being published before their intended publication time
- The post status changes to "published" but the publication date remains the originally scheduled future date
- **Specific Example:** A post scheduled for 9th October 2025 was published on 3rd October 2025

## Investigation Steps Taken

### Current Status (03/10/2025)
1. **Plugin Disabled:** The KSM Post Scheduler plugin has been temporarily disabled to isolate the issue
2. **Monitoring Phase:** Observing WordPress behavior to determine if future posts continue to be published prematurely
3. **Root Cause Analysis:** Need to determine if the issue is caused by:
   - The KSM Post Scheduler plugin itself
   - WordPress core scheduling mechanism
   - Another plugin conflict
   - Server/hosting environment issues

## Potential Causes to Investigate

### Plugin-Related Issues
- [ ] Plugin hooks interfering with WordPress cron system
- [ ] Incorrect handling of `wp_schedule_single_event()`
- [ ] Conflicts with `wp_publish_post()` function
- [ ] Issues with timezone handling
- [ ] Database queries affecting post status

### WordPress Core Issues
- [ ] WordPress cron system malfunction
- [ ] Server timezone configuration
- [ ] Database timestamp issues

### External Factors
- [ ] Other plugin conflicts
- [ ] Hosting environment cron jobs
- [ ] Server time synchronization issues

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Period:** Continue monitoring with plugin disabled for at least 1-2 weeks
2. **Data Collection:** Document any additional premature publications during monitoring period
3. **Code Review:** Once monitoring confirms plugin involvement, conduct thorough code review
4. **Testing Environment:** Set up isolated testing environment to reproduce the issue
5. **Fix Development:** Develop and test fix in controlled environment

## Technical Notes

### Files to Review (When Investigation Resumes)
- `ksm-post-scheduler.php` - Main plugin file
- `templates/admin-page.php` - Admin interface
- `assets/admin.js` - Frontend JavaScript
- WordPress hooks and filters implementation

### Key WordPress Functions to Examine
- `wp_schedule_single_event()`
- `wp_publish_post()`
- `wp_transition_post_status()`
- Custom cron implementations

## Impact Assessment
- **User Experience:** Posts appearing before intended publication time
- **Content Strategy:** Disruption of planned content release schedule
- **SEO Impact:** Potential negative effects on content timing strategy

## Resolution Timeline
- **Monitoring Phase:** 03/10/2025 - 17/10/2025 (estimated)
- **Investigation Phase:** TBD (after monitoring confirms plugin involvement)
- **Fix Development:** TBD
- **Testing & Deployment:** TBD
